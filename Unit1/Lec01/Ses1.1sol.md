### 1.1

* x1 = 1, x2 = -2, x3 = 1
* dependent, plane (means that we can perform a Gaussian elimination on this matrix.)

* How to find x using MATLAB?
  * A\b not work for this matrix
  * inv() or pinv() also not work

### 1.2
 * A = [1 2 0; 2 0 3; 4 1 1]
 * b = [3 -2 1]
 * x = A*b'
 
### 1.3
```
  A(m*n) X B(l*p) = AB(m*p)
```
