a) Suppose s and v are two subspaces in S, t and w are two subspaces
in T. Then

(s + v) + (t + w) = (s + t) + (v + w)

c(s + t) = cs + ct

Therefore, S + T is closed under linear combinations.

b) S + T is a plane, S U T is just two lines. So the span of S U T is
any vector space in R^2 which is in the union of two lines. S + T is a
vector space which is contains the span of S U T. Thus the span of S U T
is S + T.

x = 12 + 3y + z from x - 3y -z = 12

Thus, [ 12 + 3y + z; y; z] = [12 0 0] + y[3 1 0] + z[1 0 1]

N(C) = N([A;B]), C = [A; B]

N(C) = [A;B]x = 0;

Ax = 0; N(A), Bx = 0; N(B)

Thus, N(C) = N(A)âˆ© N(B)
